### Pitchersbase

In the Pitchersbase we got pitchers, catchers and **Gemini AI** 🤖

### 💡 Pitcher: 
The visionary that pitches and delivers.

### 🤝 Catcher: 
Establishes, evaluates and patronizes.

### 🤖 Gemini AI: 
Will help to find best pitchers.

### Lets get into it
Firstly the catchers are creating the competition events, providing with rules and problem to solve.

The pithchers then brainstorming and comining with a solution submission, a short video presentation, the pitch.

Finally the **Gemini AI** will be scoring the pitch based on the catchers defined rules.
Leader board with scores from **Gemini AI** will be shown at the event page. 

### The result 
Two parties with the help of Gemini either had fun and spared some prizes or maybe additionaly they will go beyond the event continue prospering together, and on and on, who knows, right?


### Stack
The Pitchersbase is build with Google Cloud - Firebase services:
- Firebase authentication
- Firestore a nosql database to store catches and picthes data
- Firebase Storage to store videos
- Firebase Cloud Function to a bit decouple the app for pitches video processing

Webapp is built with Next.js framework. Cloud function is written in python.

Happy pitching and catching!!! 😊
