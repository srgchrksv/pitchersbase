### PitchersHub

In the PitchersHub we got pitchers and catchers... and **Gemini AI** ü§ñ

### üí° Pitcher: 
The visionary that pitches and delivers.

### ü§ù Catcher: 
Establishes, evaluates and patronizes.

### ü§ñ Gemini AI: 
Will help to find best pitchers.

### Lets get into it
Firstly the catchers are creating the competition events, providing with rules and problem to solve.

The pithchers then brainstorming and comining with a solution submission, a short video presentation, the pitch.

Finally the **Gemini AI** will be scoring the pitch based on the catchers defined rules.
Leader board with scores from **Gemini AI** will be shown at the events page. 

### The result 
Two parties with the help of Gemini either had fun and some spared prizes or maybe additionaly they will go build from this event further... and on and on... who knows right?


### Stack
The PitchersHub is build with Google Cloud - Firebase services:
- Firebase authentication
- Firestore a nosql database
- Cloud function to a bit decouple the Gemini AI processing
- Firebase app hosting for fullstack deployment
- IDX IDE for code developement

The webapps frontend and one route for backend computation is build with the Next.js framework. Cloud function is written in python.
